The Eisenhower method helps you organize duties and tasks in dorder to figure out priorities. 
You pick an item from your-to-do list and ask yourself two questions. "Is it urgent," and "Is it important?"
You can now put the action into the proper quadrant.

| Urgent | Not Urgent |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| Important | Emergencies \nDees\nSome calls | Exercise \nVacation \nPlanning |
| Not Important | Interrupions \nDistactions \nOther calls | Trivia \nBusy work \nTime Wasters |

- Not urgent and not important:
> Don't do these, if you spend a lot of time here, 
> stop doing it and start spending time in the 'not urgent and important' zone.

- Urgent and not important:
> Avoid these as mush as possible. 
> When you're interrupted, handle it as fast as possible.

- Urgent and important:
> Do these, when done, spend time to think about 
> how to deal with situation in the future.

- Not Urgent and important:
> While not urgent, all your available time should go to this quadrant.
